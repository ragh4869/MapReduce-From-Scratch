Indiana University Bloomington (abbreviated "IU Bloomington"[5] and colloquially referred to as "IU" or simply "Indiana") is a public research university located in Bloomington, Indiana, United States.[6] With over 48,000 students, IU Bloomington is the flagship institution of the Indiana University system and its largest university.[7]

It is a member of the Association of American Universities and has numerous schools and programs, including the Jacobs School of Music, the School of Informatics and Computing, the Kelley School of Business, the School of Public Health, the School of Nursing, the School of Optometry, the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, the Maurer School of Law, the School of Education, the Media School, and the School of Global and International Studies.[8]

As of Fall 2015, 48,514 students attend Indiana University. While 55.2% of the student body was from Indiana, students from 49 of the 50 states, Washington D.C., and 165 foreign nations were also enrolled.[3] The university is home to an extensive student life program, with more than 750 student organizations on campus and with more than 17 percent of undergraduates joining the Greek system.[9] Indiana athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Indiana Hoosiers. The university is a member of the Big Ten Conference.

Among IU Bloomington’s many graduate-level programs are the Kelley School of Business, School of Education, School of Public and Environmental Affairs and Maurer School of Law. Indiana’s law school has a program with a first-year team-based approach, a diversion from the typical legal education. Notable Indiana alumni include composer and songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, who penned “Georgia on My Mind"; John Chambers, executive chairman and former CEO of Cisco Systems; and Mark Cuban, billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Landmark Theatres, and Magnolia Pictures.

In terms of academics and other criteria, IU Bloomington ranks in top 100 national universities in the United States and the top 50 public universities in the country. The school's sports teams are notorious competitors in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference, and, since Indiana University does not have a mascot, all teams are known simply as Hoosiers. There are more than 650 student organizations on campus, and more than 5,000 students go Greek in the school’s large community of fraternities and sororities.[10]
